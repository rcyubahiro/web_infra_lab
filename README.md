# Web Infrastructure Lab

This repository provides a lightweight environment to demonstrate web server setup and basic load balancing using Docker containers. The stack consists of two web servers (`web-01` and `web-02`) and a load balancer (`lb-01`) connected to a custom Docker network. Each service runs Ubuntu 24.04 with SSH enabled to allow you to install and configure additional software.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- At least 2 GB of free RAM and a few hundred megabytes of disk space

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd web_infra_lab
   ```
2. Bring up the lab environment (builds the images on first run):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
3. Verify that the containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```
   You should see `web-01`, `web-02`, and `lb-01` online. The services are attached to the `lablan` network with the following addresses:

   | Container | IP           | Exposed Ports |
   |---------- |------------- |---------------|
   | web-01    | 172.20.0.11  | 2211 (SSH), 8080 (HTTP) |
   | web-02    | 172.20.0.12  | 2212 (SSH), 8081 (HTTP) |
   | lb-01     | 172.20.0.10  | 2210 (SSH), 8082 (HTTP) |

4. Connect to each container using SSH if you prefer an interactive terminal. All containers include an `ubuntu` user with the password `pass123`.
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 2211  # web-01
   ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 2212  # web-02
   ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 2210  # lb-01
   ```

## Nginx Setup on `web-01` and `web-02`

Within each `web-*` container install Nginx and host a small static site. For example:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx
sudo bash -c 'echo "<h1>web-01</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html'
```

Repeat for `web-02`, modifying the page content so you can tell the two servers apart. After starting Nginx (`sudo systemctl restart nginx`), visit the host ports http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8081 to verify the pages load.

## Activity â€“ Configure HAProxy on `lb-01`

Your task is to configure HAProxy on `lb-01` to load balance requests between `web-01` and `web-02` using the **roundrobin** algorithm. Additionally, each response must include a custom header `X-Served-By` indicating which backend served the request.

Steps to complete the activity:

1. Install HAProxy inside `lb-01`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y haproxy
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` so that the frontend listens on port `80` and forwards to the two backends. Example snippet:
   ```
   global
       daemon
       maxconn 256

   defaults
       mode http
       timeout connect 5s
       timeout client  50s
       timeout server  50s

   frontend http-in
       bind *:80
       default_backend servers

   backend servers
       balance roundrobin
       server web01 172.20.0.11:80 check
       server web02 172.20.0.12:80 check
       http-response set-header X-Served-By %[srv_name]
   ```
3. Restart HAProxy to apply your configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart haproxy
   ```

### Verifying the Load Balancer

From your host machine run:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8082
```
Repeated requests should alternate between `web-01` and `web-02` and the `X-Served-By` header in the output will reveal which server handled each request.

Feel free to experiment with the configuration and explore additional features of HAProxy. When you are finished with the lab environment, shut it down with:
```bash
docker compose down
```

Enjoy your lightweight web infrastructure lab!
